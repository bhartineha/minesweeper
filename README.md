# How to play
The rules in Minesweeper are simple:

1. Uncover a mine, and the game ends.

2. Uncover an empty square, and you keep playing.

3. Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding squaresâ€”information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.

The board - 10 mines
Header has mineCounter, Faces (hasWon, hasLost, resetFace), and Timer
NumberDisplayed on board from 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

2. Set mines randomly on tiles, and when user click on any tiles which has mines underneath, it will end the game and uncover all the mines on the tiles.

3. Set numbers adjecent to mines which means there will to 1 mines hidden adjacent to number 1 in the eight square, 2 mines adjacent to the number 2 in the eight square and so.
